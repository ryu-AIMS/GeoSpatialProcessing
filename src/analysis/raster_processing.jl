    set_consistent_missingval(raster, val)

Replace value used to indicate no data, and return a Raster type with this value set.

## Note
`raster` should cover the smallest possible extent to reduce processing time.

# Arguments
- `raster` : data to reconfigure
- `val` : Value to use to indicate no data

# Returns
Raster

Cleans up valid pixels that are by themselves and not worth including in later assessments.

# Arguments
- `rst_mask` : Mask of valid raster locations
- `min_cluster_size` : Number of elements that need to be clustered together to be kept
- `box_size` : area to search around center pixel (width, height). Must be odd numbers.
